Hi, I’m Anupam Singh, a recent Ph.D. graduate from the University of Southern California. My thesis work focused on using statistical models like linear, mixed models to understand the genetic basis of traits. I spent a lot of time understanding the quality of both genomic and phenotype data. This meant disentangling the signal from all the noise in the available data. 
While a lot of credit is given to data analysis and outcome, I believe that systematic understanding of the data and spending time assessing its quality holds a lot of merits. 
I am driven by scientific questions and enjoy learning skills that help me answer them.

Besides science, I enjoy cooking, singing, and going on hikes.  You can reach me via email : anupamsingh194@gmail.com
